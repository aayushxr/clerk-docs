## How to use the `useAuth()` hook

> [!NOTE]
> For Next.js applications, it's recommended to use the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper instead of `useAuth()`. Since `auth()` works in server components, you'll need to pass auth data to Client Components as needed. If you prefer `useAuth()`, enable it by passing the `dynamic` prop to `<ClerkProvider>`, but be aware this switches to dynamic rendering. Learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/rendering-modes).

Use `useAuth()` to access the authentication state and fetch data using a session token:

```tsx {{ filename: 'ExternalDataPage.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function ExternalDataPage() {
  const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth()

  const fetchExternalData = async () => {
    const token = await getToken()

    // Fetch data from an external API
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    })

    return response.json()
  }

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>
  }

  return <div>{/* Add your component content here */}</div>
}
```
