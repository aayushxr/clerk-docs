description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Vue application.

The Clerk Vue SDK is a wrapper around the Clerk JavaScript SDK. It is the recommended way to integrate Clerk into your Vue application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using Nuxt, we recommend installing the `@clerk/nuxt` package since it's specifically built as a Nuxt module and includes backend integration. See the [Nuxt](/docs/references/nuxt/overview) documentation for more information.

Clerk Vue provides Vue implementations of [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview); highly customizable, prebuilt components that you can use to build beautiful user management applications. You can find display components for building [sign-in](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in), [sign-up](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up), [account switching](/docs/components/user/user-button), and [user profile management](/docs/components/user/user-profile) pages as well as flow [control components](/docs/components/control/signed-in) that act as helpers for implementing a seamless authentication experience.

Clerk Vue provides a suite of [custom composables](/docs/references/vue/use-user). These composables give you access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

## Setting up Clerk Vue

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Vue. For more information, check out [the dedicated guide.](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk)

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and start using Clerk Vue in your application. [The quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/vue) will have all the information you need to get started.
