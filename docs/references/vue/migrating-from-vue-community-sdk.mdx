title: 'Migrating from the Vue community SDK'
description: Learn how to migrate from the Vue community SDK to the Clerk Vue SDK.
---

In December 2024, we introduced official support for Vue. This migration guide covers converting from the [`vue-clerk`](https://vue-clerk.vercel.app) community SDK to Clerk's official SDK. It covers the breaking changes that were introduced and provides examples on how to resolve them.

## Installation

Uninstall the community SDK and install Clerk's new official SDK for Vue.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm uninstall vue-clerk
  npm install @clerk/vue
  ```

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  yarn remove vue-clerk
  yarn add @clerk/vue
  ```

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  pnpm remove vue-clerk
  pnpm add @clerk/vue
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Breaking Changes

### The `useClerk()` composable

The composable now returns a Vue [Ref](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) containing the Clerk instance, rather than returning the instance directly.

Since it now returns a Ref, update your code as follows:

```vue {{ del: [2, 9], ins: [3, [10, 11]] }}
<script setup>
import { useClerk } from 'vue-clerk'
import { useClerk } from '@clerk/vue'

const clerk = useClerk()
const clerk = useClerk()

function signIn() {
  clerk.openSignIn()
  // Use optional chaining since clerk.value is only available after the Clerk script is loaded
  clerk.value?.openSignIn()
}
</script>

<template>
    <button @click="signIn">Sign in</button>
</template>
```

Everything else should work as expected - just make sure to replace all `vue-clerk` imports with `@clerk/vue`.
