When deploying a Clerk app to a web server or container, you may need to proxy two headers for Clerk to work correctly. The two headers that you must forward are:
* `X-Forwarded-Host`
* `X-Forwarded-Proto`

## `nginx` configuration example

The following can be added to your `nginx` configuration to forward these two headers to your application.

```nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
```

## How to test if the headers are forwarded correctly:

You can console log the `X-forwarded-host` and `X-forwarded-proto` to check what the value is. The following example is for Next.js.

```ts 
export default clerkMiddleware(
  (auth, req) => {

    console.log('=========================');
    console.log('Request Headers');
    console.log('x-forwarded-host', req.headers.get('x-forwarded-host'));
    console.log('x-forwarded-proto', req.headers.get('x-forwarded-proto'));
    console.log('=========================');
  },
  { debug: debugStatus },
);
````
